\subsection{Instantiation from DDH}

In this subsection we use a group \G of prime order $p$ and $g$ is a generator or \G. For simplicity, we use the bracket notation $\lb a\rb$ to denote $g^a$, inparticular $\lb 1\rb:=g$. For vector $\vec{a}=(a_1,\ldots,a_n)$, we use $\lb \vec{a}\rb$ to denote $(\lb a_1\rb,\ldots,\lb a_n\rb)$. We use the same notation, i.e. $\lb A\rb$, also for a matrix $A$.

\begin{definition}[Decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH) Assumption]
For a group $\G$, the \emph{decisional Diffie-Hellman} assumption is hard if for any ppt distinguisher \D,
$$
|\Pr\lb \D(1^\sec,\lb 1\rb,\lb a\rb,\lb b\rb,\lb ab\rb)=1\rb-\Pr\lb D(1^\sec,g,\lb a\rb,\lb b\rb,\lb c\rb)=1\rb|=\negl,
$$
where $a\leftarrow\Z_p$, $b\leftarrow\Z_p$ and $c\leftarrow\Z_p$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[$n$ Multi-Instance DDH Assumption]
For a group $\G$, the \emph{decisional Diffie-Hellman} assumption is hard if for any ppt distinguisher \D,
$$
|\Pr\lb \D(1^\sec,\lb 1\rb,\lb \vec{a}\rb,\lb b\rb,\lb \vec{a}b\rb)=1\rb-\Pr\lb D(1^\sec,\lb 1\rb,\lb \vec{a}\rb,\lb b\rb,\lb \vec{c}\rb)=1\rb|=\negl,
$$
where $\vec{a}\leftarrow\Z_p^n$, $b\leftarrow\Z_p$ and $\vec{c}\leftarrow\Z_p^n$.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:DHuniform}
Let DDH be secure over \G except advantage $\epsilon$, then $n$ multi-instance DDH is secure over \G except at most advantage $n\epsilon$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
This lemma follows from a simple hybrid argument. We define hybrid $\hyb_i$ as the distribution over $\lb \vec{a}\rb,\lb b\rb,\lb \vec{c}\rb$, where for all $j\leq i$, $c_j=a_jb$ and for $j>i$, $c_j\leftarrow\Z_p$. If $\D$ distinguishes hybrid $\hyb_i$ from $\hyb_{i+1}$, it breaks the DDH assumption over \G.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:DDH}
Let $Q$ and $n$ be polynomial in $\sec$.
The Diffie-Hellman key exchange over \G is unconditionally $Q$ multi-instance uniform. Further, let the $n$ multi-instance DDH assumption hold over group \G except with advantage $\epsilon$, then the Diffie-Hellman key exchange is $(Q,n)$ one-round multi-instance key indistinguishable except advantage $\epsilon-\negl$. 
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The distribution of $\lb a\rb$ over \G is uniform, therefore 
$$
|\Pr\lb \D^{\O_{\A}}(1^{\sec})\rb=1\rb-Pr\lb \D^{\O_{u}}(1^{\sec})=1\rb|=0,
$$
even against an unbounded $\D$. Hence, the Diffie-Hellman key exchange is unconditional $Q$ multi-instance uniform.

For proving the second part of the lemma, we construct a ppt distinguisher \D that breaks $n$ multi-instance DDH assumption given a ppt distinguisher $\D_\key$ that breaks the $(Q,n)$ multi-instance key indistinguishability of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange. $\D$ receives a challenge $\lb \vec{a}\rb,\lb b\rb,\lb \vec{c}\rb$, sets $\mes_{\B}:=\lb b\rb$ and invokes $\D_{\key}$ on input $\mes_{\B}$. On the $j$-th query of $\D_{\key}$ to $\O_{\A}$, \D samples $\vec{r}_j\leftarrow\Z_p^{n+1}$ and responds with $\mes_{\A,j}:=\lb \langle (\vec{a},1),\vec{r}_j\rangle\rb=\lb a_1\rb^{r_{j,1}}\cdot\lb a_2\rb^{r_{j,2}}\ldots\lb a_n\rb^{r_{j,n}}\cdot\lb r_{j,n+1}\rb$. When $\D_{\key}$ queries $\O_{\key}$ for key $\key_j$, \D responds with $\key_j:=\lb \langle\vec{c},\vec{r}_j\rangle\rb=\lb c_1\rb^{r_{j,1}}\cdot\lb c_2\rb^{r_{j,2}}\ldots\lb c_n\rb^{r_{j,n}}\cdot\lb b\rb^{r_{j,n+1}}$. In the end, $\D$ outputs the output of $\D_{\key}$.

It is easy to see that $\O_{\A}$ has the correct output distribution. $r_{j,n+1}$ is uniform over $\Z_p$ and hence $\mes_{\A,j}$ is. Further, conditioned on $\mes_{\A,j}$, $r_{j,1},\ldots,r_{j,n}$ are uniform. Given that $\vec{c}=\vec{a}b$, the output
$$
\key_j=\lb \langle\vec{c},\vec{r}_j\rangle\rb\cdot\lb b\rb^{r_{j,n+1}}=\lb \langle\vec{a}b,\vec{r}_j\rangle\rb\cdot\lb b\rb^{r_{j,n+1}}=\lb \langle(\vec{a},1),\vec{r}_j\rangle\rb^b=\mes_{\A,j}^b
$$
of $\O_{\key}$ is also distributed correctly. In case that $\vec{c}$ is uniform, we need to show that all the $n$ outputs of $\O_{\key}$, $\vec{\key}=\key_1,\ldots,\key_n$ are uniform. Let $\mes_i$ be the message $\mes_{\A,j}$ and $\vec{t}_i$ the randomness $\vec{r}_j$ that corresponds to $\key_i$. Since $\vec{c}$ is uniform and $\vec{\key}=\lb \vec{c}\cdot T\rb$, where $T$ is the matrix with $i$-th column $\vec{t}_i$, $\vec{\key}$ is uniform if $T$ is invertible. Since $r_{j,1},\ldots,r_{j,n}$ are uniform given $\mes_{\A,j}$ so is $T$. For a uniform $T$ over $\Z_p^{n\times n}$, the probability that $T$ is invertible is that all the rows are linear independent, i.e. 
$$
\Pr\lb T\text{ invertible}\rb= \frac{1}{p^{n^2}}\prod_{i=0}^{n-1}(p^n-p^i)\geq\left(1-\frac{1}{p}\right)^n\geq 1-\negl.
$$ 
Therefore, except with negligible probability, $\D$ has the same advantage in breaking $n$ multi-instance DDH as $\D_{\key}$ has in breaking $(Q,n)$ one-round multi-instance key indistinguishability .
\end{proof}

Using Theorem~\ref{thm:KAtoOT}, Lemma~\ref{lem:DHuniform} and Lemma~\ref{lem:DDH}, we obtain the following corollary.

\begin{corollary}
When instantiating an $1$ out of $n$ OT in \figureref{fig:oneroundKAtoOT} with Diffie-Hellman key exchange over group \G, then in the programmable random oracle model the resulting endemic OT is statistically secure against malicious senders making at most polynomially many random oracle queries and secure against malicious receivers except advantage $(n-1)Q\epsilon_{\DDH}+\negl$, where the DDH assumption over group $\G$ holds except advantage $\epsilon_{\DDH}$ and $Q$ is a bound on the amount of adversarial random oracle queries.
\end{corollary}

\begin{remark}
If we apply a hardcore predicate to $\key_{\A}$ and $\key_{\B}$ in the protocol in \figureref{fig:DH} and apply the transformation \figureref{fig:oneroundKAtoOT}, we receive a one-round endemically secure OT in the random oracle model based on the computational Diffie-Hellman assumption. Alternatively, one could also use the random oracle instead of a hardcore predicate to obtain longer OT strings. 
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}[Crystals-Kyber CPAPKE]
\emph{ Crystals-Kyber CPAPKE} is a correct and CPA secure public key encryption based on the Module LWE (\MLWE) assumption. We follow the specifications of Kyber, in which $\kB$ denotes the  set $\{0,1,\ldots,255\}$. Kyber is parameterized by parameters $d_t=11$, $\nLWE=256$, $\kLWE\in\{2,3,4\}$, $q=7681$ and ring $\R_q=\Z_q\lb X\rb/(X^{\nLWE}+1)$. 

$(\kybergen,\kyberenc,\kyberdec)$ have the following syntax. 
\begin{description}
\item[$\kybergen$:] Outputs a secret and public key pair $\pk,\sk$, where $\pk=(\cdt,\rho)\in\kB^{\frac{\kLWE\nLWE d_t}{8}}\times\kB^{32}$.
\item[$\kyberenc$:] Takes as input a public key $\pk$, a message $\mes\in\kB^{32}$ and random coins $\tape\in\kB^{32}$. It outputs a ciphertext $\kyberc$.
\item[$\kyberdec$:] Takes as input secret key $\sk$ and a ciphertext $\kyberc$. It outputs a message $\mes$.
\end{description}
Further, Crystals-Kyber specifies the following algorithms.
\begin{description}
\item[$\kdec_\ell$:] Takes a an element in $\kB^{32\ell}$ and maps it to $\R_q$. The inverse operation is $\kenc_\ell$.
\item[$\kcom_q(*,d)$:] Takes a an element in $\R_q$ and maps it to a polynomial with coefficients in $\Z_{2^d}$. The inverse operation is $\kdecom_q(*,d)$.
\item[$\kparse$:] Takes a uniform byte stream in $\kB^{*}$ and maps it to a uniform element in $\R_q$.
\end{description}
\end{definition}

It is important to know, that $\cdt:=\kenc_{d_t}(\kcom_q(\mt, d_t)$, where $\mt$ is computationally indistinguishable from a uniform element in $\R_q^{\kLWE}$ based on the \MLWE assumption. In the following, we will choose $d_t=13$ such that $q<2^{d_t}$ and no compression takes place. This will help us to avoid complications and does not decrease efficiency besides a sligthly larger public key $\pk$. Further, we will keep component $\rho$ of $\pk$ consistent between all $\pk$ used in a single $1$ out of $n$ OT.

In order to instantiate our framework, we need to define a group operation $\pk\oplus\pk$ and a hash functions that maps to a uniform $\cdt$ component of $\pk$, i.e. a uniform element in $\R_q^{\kLWE}$. For the latter, we use a hash function that produces an output bit stream, which is in $\kB^{*}$, and use $\kLWE$ different parts of the stream and apply $\kparse$ to the $\kLWE$ streams to obtain a (pseudo) uniform element in $\R_q^{\kLWE}$ whenever the bit streams are (pseudo) uniform.

We define the group operation $\pk_1\oplus\pk_2$, by mapping $\pk_1=(\cdt_1,\rho)$, $\pk_2=(\cdt_2,\rho)$ to $\pk_3=(\cdt_3, \rho)$, where $\cdt_3=\kenc_{13}(\kdec_{13}(\cdt_1)+\kdec_{13}(\cdt_2))$ and $+$ is the addition in $\R_q^{\kLWE}$. $\ominus$ is defined correspondingly. 

By using \theoremref{thm:KAtoOT}, \lemmaref{lem:multuniform} and \lemmaref{lem:keytomultkey}, we get the following corollary.
 
\begin{corollary}
When instantiating an $1$ out of $n$ OT in \figureref{fig:oneroundKAtoOT} with Crystals-Kyber, then in the programmable random oracle model the resulting endemic OT is secure against a malicious sender except advantage $(n-1)\epsilon_{\MLWE}+\negl$  and secure against malicious receivers except advantage $Q^2\epsilon_{\MLWE}+\negl$, where the \MLWE assumption holds except advantage $\epsilon_{\DDH}$ and $Q$ is a bound on the amount of adversarial random oracle queries.
\end{corollary}
