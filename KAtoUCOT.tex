\section{UC Security against Malicious Receivers}\label{sec:UCOT}

In \theoremref{thm:KAtoOT} in \sectionref{sec:endemicOT}, we only show stand-alone security. While UC security for a malicious sender is already covered by \claimref{claim:malsender}, 
\claimref{claim:malreceiver} uses an adversary \Adv' that rewinds \Adv and hence does not accomplish UC security. Here, we proof UC security against a malicious receiver for two settings. First, in case of a two-round OT from any uniform two-round key agreement. Second, in case of a one-round OT based on the Diffie Hellman key agreement under a variant of \DDH.  


\subsection{UC Security of the Two-Round OT}
 
\begin{claim}\label{claim:UCmalreceiver}
Given a $\delta$ correct,  $Q$-multi-instance $\epsilon_u$-uniform,  $(Q,n-1)$-multi-instance $\epsilon_k$-key indistinguishable two-round \UKA scheme, where $Q$ upper bounds the amount of random oracle queries by an adversary. Then the proposed two-round OT is UC-secure against malicious receivers, i.e. in the programmable random oracle model for any ppt adversary \Adv, there exists a ppt adversary \Adv' such that for any ppt distinguisher \D and any polynomial size auxiliary input $z$,
$$
|\Pr[\D(z,(\send, \Adv)_{\Pi})=1] -\Pr[\D(z,(\OOT^\E,\Adv'))=1]|\leq \epsilon_{u}+\epsilon_{k}+(1-\delta),
$$
where all algorithms receive input $1^\sec$.
\end{claim}


\begin{proof}
We follow the same line of arguement as in \claimref{claim:malreceiver} with the exception that we now use a hybrid argument rather than guessing the correct random oracle query. 

A malicious receiver will make random oracle queries and each query will correspond to a potential choice for $(r_i)_{i\in[n]}$. For each potential choice of $(r_i)_{i\in[n]}$ there will be corresponding OT strings, i.e. keys computed by the key agreement.
 
During the first hybrid, we replace the corresponding keys of the first random oracle query with uniform. Through a sequence of hybrids, we will do this for every query until all the keys are replaced with uniform. Notice that in each hybrid, $\D$ will only get to see the key that corresponds to the malicious receivers choice of $(r_i)_{i\in[n]}$ and not for all potential choices of $(r_i)_{i\in[n]}$.


We start by giving a description of \Adv'. For each random oracle query $q$ to $\H_i$ for an $i\in[n]$, \Adv' responds with a random group element $\H_i(q)\leftarrow\G$.
 When \Adv sends $(r_i)_{i\in[n]}$, \Adv' looks up the first oracle query of the form $q= (r_1,\dots, r_{i^*-1},r_{i^*+1},\dots, r_{n})$ for an $i^*\in[n]$. \Adv' sends $i^*$ to $\OOT^\E$. \Adv' computes for all $i\in[n]$ $\mes_{\A,i}:=r_i\oplus\H_i((r_\ell)_{\ell\neq i})$, $\tape_{\B,i}\leftarrow\bits^*$ and $\mes_{\B,i}\leftarrow\B(\tape_{\B,i},\mes_{\A,i})$. It also computes $s_{\B,i^*}:=\EK(\tape_{\B,i^*},\mes_{\A,i^*})$.
\Adv' sends $s_{\B,i^*}$ to $\OOT^\E$, $(\mes_{\B,i})_{i\in[n]}$ to \Adv and outputs the output of \Adv. This concludes the description of \Adv'. We emphasize that here, the other OT strings $(s_{\B,i})_{i\neq i^*}$ will not be the output of $\EK(\tape_{\B,i},\mes_{\A,i})$ but sampled uniformly by $\OOT^\E$.

We now define a sequence of hybrids. The first hybrid is $\hyb_0$ and corresponds the interaction of \Adv with the sender of the protocol description. The last hybrid, $\hyb_{3(Q+1)}$, corresponds to $\Adv'$.
For $k\in\{0\}\cup[Q]$, we define:
\begin{description}
\item[$\hyb_{3k}$:]  When \Adv makes an oracle query $q$ respond with a random group element $\H_i(q)\leftarrow\G$. 

When \Adv sends $(r_i)_{i\in[n]}$, look up the first oracle query of the form $q= (r_1,\dots, r_{d-1},r_{d+1},\dots, r_{n})$ to $\H_d$ for a $d\in[n]$. Let $j$ be the query number. Compute for all $i\in[n]$, $\mes_{\A,i}:=r_i\oplus\H_i((r_\ell)_{\ell\neq i})$, $\tape_{\B,i}\leftarrow\bits^*$ and $\mes_{\B,i}\leftarrow\B(\tape_{\B,i},\mes_{\A,i})$. Further, compute $s_{\B,i}:=\EK(\tape_{\B,i},\mes_{\A,i})$. If $j<k$, sample for all $i\neq d$, $s_i$ uniformly. Otherwise, for all $i\neq d$, $s_i:=s_{\B,i}$.

 Send $(\mes_{\B,i})_{i\in[n]}$ to \Adv and output $\set_{\B,d}$ together with the output of \Adv. 
 \item[$\hyb_{3k+2}$:]  When \Adv makes an oracle query $q$ to $\H_i$ for an $i\in[n]$ and the query number is less or equal to $k$, Respond with a random group element $\H_i(q)\leftarrow\G$. 
If the query number equals $k$, store $i^*:=i$ and $(g^*_1,\dots, g^*_{i^*-1},g^*_{i^*+1},\dots, g^*_{n}):=q_{\inda}$. 
For all following random oracle queries, i.e. the query number $j$ is higher than $k$, respond with a random group element $\H_i(q)\leftarrow\G$ if $i=i^*$ or for all $g\in\G$ $q_j\neq (g^*_1,\dots, g^*_{i^*-1},g,g^*_{i^*+1},\dots, g^*_{n})\setminus g^*_i$.

\end{description}

\begin{claim}\label{claim:first}
For any $k\in\{0\}\cup[Q]$, let there be a distinguisher $\D$ with
$$
\epsilon_{\D}:=|\Pr[\D(z,\hyb_{3k})=1] -\Pr[\D(z,\hyb_{3k+1})=1]|.
$$
Then, there is a distinguisher $\D_u$ breaking the $Q$-multi-instance uniformity of the \UKA protocol.
\end{claim}

\begin{proof}
 $\D_u$ gets access to an oracle $\O$ which either outputs uniform messages, i.e. $\O_u$ or messages of  the form $\mes_\A\leftarrow\A(\tape_\A)$ for $\tape_\A\leftarrow\bits^*$. $\D_u$ invokes \D and creates its input as follows. It invokes $\Adv$ and interacts with him as $\hyb_{3k+1}$ does with the difference that $\mes_j$ are requested from $\O$ rather than computing them.  After receiving the output, $\D_u$ uses it as input for $\D$ together with $(s_{\B,i})_{i\in[n]}$, where $s_{\B,i}\leftarrow\EK(\tape_{\B,i},\mes_{\A,i})$. $\D_u$ outputs the output of \D. 

If $\O$ is oracle $\O_{u}$, all $\mes_j$ are uniform and hence all random oracle queries $q$ are answered with a uniformly random $\H_i(q)\in\G$.  Otherwise, \Adv' is identical with \send as well as $(s_{\B,i})_{i\in[n]}$ are identical with the output of \send.  
Hence 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\epsilon_{u}&=&|\Pr[\D_u^{\O_{\A}}(z)]=1]-Pr[\D_u^{\O_{u}}(z)=1]|\\
&= &|\Pr[\D(z,((s_{\B,i})_{i\in[n]},\Adv)_{\D_u^{\O_{\A}}})=1]\\
&&-\Pr[\D(z,((s_{\B,i})_{i\in[n]},\Adv)_{\D_u^{\O_{u}}})=1]|\\
&\geq&\epsilon_{\D}.
\end{eqnarray*}
\pe
\end{proof}


\begin{claim}
For any $k\in\{0\}\cup[Q]$, let there be a distinguisher $\D$ with
$$
\epsilon_{\D}:=|\Pr[\D(z,\hyb_{3k+1})=1] -\Pr[\D(z,\hyb_{3k+2})=1]|.
$$
Then there is a distinguisher $\D_k$ that breaks the $(Q,n-1)$-multi-instance key-indistinguishability of the \UKA protocol.
\end{claim}

\begin{proof}
$\D_k$ has access to oracles $\O_{\langle \A,\B\rangle}$ and \O which is either $\O_u$ or $\O_k$. $\D_k$ invokes $\D$ and creates its input as follows. $\D_k$ invokes \Adv and interacts with it as $\hyb_{3k+2}$ does with the difference, that $\D_k$ generates $\mes_j$ by querying a transcript $\langle \A, \B\rangle=(\mes_{\A,j}',\mes_{\B,j}')$ from $\O_{\langle \A,\B\rangle}$ and setting $\mes_j=\mes_{\A,j}'$. 

If $(r_i)_{i\in[n]}$ corresponds to a query $j\neq k$, then $\hyb_{3k+1}$ and $\hyb_{3k+2}$ are equivalent. Follow the description of $\hyb_{3k+1}$ and ignore oracle $\O$, since the keys for the challenge transcripts are not needed.

If $(r_i)_{i\in[n]}$ corresponds to query $k$,
compute for all $i\in[n]\setminus\{i^*\}$
$$
\mes_{\A,i}:=r_i\oplus\H_i((r_{\ell})_{\ell\neq i})=\mes_{\A,j}'
$$
where there exists a $j\in[Q]$ such that the last equality holds. It also uses oracle $\O$ to query for all $i\in[n]\setminus\{i^*\}$ the $n-1$ corresponding keys $\key_i$ that match with the transcripts containing $\mes_{\A,i}$. $\D_k$ sets $\mes_{\B,i}:=\mes_{\B,j}'$ and $s_{\B,i}:=\key_i$. It creates $\mes_{\B,i^*}$ and $s_{\B,i^*}$ as usual. It sends $(\mes_{\B,i})_{i\in[n]}$ to \Adv to receive its output which it uses together with $(s_{\B,i})_{i\in[n]}$ as input for \D. $\D_k$ outputs \D's output.  
\begin{eqnarray*}
\epsilon_{k}&=&|\Pr[\D_k^{\O_{k}}(z)]=1]-Pr[\D_k^{\O_{u}}(z)=1]|\\
&= &|\Pr[\D(z,((s_{\B,i})_{i\in[n]},\Adv)_{\D_k^{\O_{k}}})=1]\\
&&-Pr[\D(z,(\set_{\B,i^*},\Adv)_{\D_k^{\O_{u}}})=1]|\\
&\geq&\epsilon_{\D}.
\end{eqnarray*}
\pe
\end{proof}

\begin{claim}\label{claim:first}
For any $k\in\{0\}\cup[Q]$, let there be a distinguisher $\D$ with
$$
\epsilon_{\D}:=|\Pr[\D(z,\hyb_{3k+2})=1] -\Pr[\D(z,\hyb_{3k+3})=1]|.
$$
Then, there is a distinguisher $\D_u$ breaking the $Q$-multi-instance uniformity of the \UKA protocol.
\end{claim}

\begin{proof}
The proof is almost identical to the proof of \claimref{claim:first} and therefore omitted.
\pe
\end{proof}

For the last step, we need to replace $s_{\B,i^*}$ with $s_{\A,i^*}$. We use the same argument as in Claim~\ref{claim:malsender} using the correctness of the scheme. Hence we obtain

\begin{eqnarray*}
\epsilon_{\OT} &=&|\Pr[\D(z,(\send, \Adv)_{\Pi})=1] -\Pr[\D(z,(\OOT^\E,\Adv))=1]|\\
&\leq &2Q\epsilon_{u}+Q\epsilon_{k}+(1-\delta).
\end{eqnarray*}
\pe
\end{proof}


\begin{remark}
For stand alone security, security of \UKA against uniform adversaries is sufficient, i.e. auxiliary input $z$ is the empty string. Further, for UC security in the global random oracle model, it is sufficient for the sender to send a salt at the start of each session that is used as an additional input to the random oracle within the session. 
\end{remark}
