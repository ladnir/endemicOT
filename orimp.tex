As we have shown, endemic security allows to obtain any of the other notions efficiently. But as we show in the following lemmas, there can not be a one-round OT that achieves receiver or sender chosen message security. An adversary is at least able to tweak the distribution of the OT messages. As we will show in the upcoming section, there are OT protocols with a single round based on one-round key agreement.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:nosendtweak}
There is no sender chosen message secure two message OT where the sender sends its message first. 
\end{lemma}


\begin{lemma}\label{lem:norectweak}
There is no receiver chosen message secure two message OT where the receiver sends its message first.
\end{lemma}

Intuitively, if a malicious sender or receiver can choose its message in a two message protocol after seeing the message of the other party, he can bias the output distribution by resampling his message after observing what the learned OT message would be. We refer the reader for the formal argument to 
\appendixref{sec:roundcomp}.
