\section{Introduction}

An oblivious transfer (OT) \cite{Rabin81,C:EveGolLem82} is a cryptographic primitive often used in the context of secure multi party computation, which allows to preserve the privacy during a joint computation. Among others, it solves the task of securely distributing cryptographic keys for garbled circuits, which can be seen as encrypted programs. The combination of garbled circuits and oblivious transfer gives a generic solution for securely computing any functionality between two parties \cite{FOCS:Yao82b,FOCS:Yao86,STOC:Kilian88,C:IshPraSah08,EC:IKOPS11} and multiple parties \cite{C:CreVanTap95,EC:BenLin18,EC:GarSri18a}.   


In an OT, a sender and a receiver interact in a protocol and at the end of the protocol, the sender outputs two messages $s_0$, $s_1$ while the receiver outputs $b, s_b$ for choice bit $b$. Security asks that the sender does not learn $b$ and the receiver does not learn $s_{1-b}$. It is known that an OT implies key exchange and can be constructed from special types of public key encryption (PKE) \cite{FOCS:GKMRV00,C:PeiVaiWat08,cryptoeprint:2018:473}, generalizations of dual mode PKE \cite{TCC:GarIshSri18} or certified trapdoor permutations \cite{C:OstRicSca15}. Though, all of these solutions come with some drawbacks when it comes to practical deployment. They either only achieve a weak security notion \cite{FOCS:GKMRV00} or lack efficiency due to a special type of commitment protocol \cite{STOC:Kilian92,C:OstRicSca15,cryptoeprint:2018:473} or dual-mode cryptosystem \cite{C:PeiVaiWat08, TCC:GarIshSri18}, which is less efficient than standard PKE and only known from DDH, QR and LWE with weaker parameter choices\footnote{Peikert et al. require SIVP hardness for approximation factor $\tilde{O}(n^{3.5})$ while Regev's PKE \cite{STOC:Regev05} only requires $\tilde{O}(n^{1.5})$.}. There exist also solutions tailored to specific assumptions. Naor and Pinkas \cite{SODA:NaoPin01} constructed OTs from the DDH assumption and Brakerski and D\"ottling \cite{TCC:BraDot18} from the LWE assumption that requires similar parameter choices as Peikert et al \cite{C:PeiVaiWat08}.

In practice, a common approach is to use a critical amount of OTs in the random oracle model (ROM) \cite{CCS:BelRog93} and then extend the amount of OTs to the desired amount of OTs using OT extension \cite{STOC:Beaver96a,C:IKNP03,RSA:OrrOrsSch17,EC:ALSZ15,C:KelOrsSch15}. A random oracle is an ideal hash function that usually is instantiated with a concrete hash function in the implementation. The ROM brings major efficiency improvements and is therefore very common for practical cryptographic constructions, even though it might bring potential security weaknesses \cite{STOC:CanGolHal98}. 

In the ROM, Bellare \& Micali \cite{C:BelMic89} constructed OT based on the CDH assumption. Chou \& Orlandi \cite{LC:ChoOrl15} claimed a more efficient OT construction which was proven with some caveats under the GapDH assumption \cite{cryptoeprint:2017:1011}. Hauck \& Loss improved the construction to base it on the CDH assumption \cite{cryptoeprint:2017:1011}. Barreto et al. \cite{EPRINT:BDDMN17b} constructed an CDH based OT in the global random oracle model.  

A drawback of the more efficient constructions of Chou \& Orlandi, Hauck \& Loss, and Barreto et al. is that they require three or more rounds. The former also suffers technical issues with the ability to extract the input of the receiver \cite{LC:ChoOrl15}. Further, unlike the more generic constructions based on PKE, they are tailored to specific assumptions. A more generic construction for OT in the ROM would be preferable since it allows an easier transition to different assumption like LWE or LPN, which unlike CDH and DDH are assumed to offer security in presence of quantum computers. In this work, we therefore want to focus on the question:

\begin{center}
\emph{How to construct a versatile, highly efficient and fully secure OT in the ROM?}
\end{center}

For efficiency, we ask for a minimal round complexity, low computational complexity and compatibility with OT extension techniques.

\subsection{Our Contribution}

We start with a basic security definition which has previously been considered by Garg, Ishai and Srinivasan \cite{TCC:GarIshSri18} as OT correlations functionality. We call this security \emph{endemic} security and denote an OT that is endemically secure with endemic OT. Endemic security allows to achieve a minimal round complexity, also denoted as non-interactive OT \cite{C:BelMic89,TCC:GarIshSri18} as well as analyze the security of optimized existing OT and OT extension protocols.

In \sectionref{sec:relot}, we compare endemic security notion with other notions and show that an endemic OT can efficiently  be transformed such the other considered security notions are achieved but potentially at the cost of a higher round complexity. We also show that  only endemic security permits a one-round or non-interactive OT.

In \sectionref{sec:endemicOT}, we give a construction in the ROM that transforms any two message key agreement protocol, where the distribution of one of the messages is computationally close to uniform, into an endemically secure two message $1$-out-of-$n$ oblivious transfer\footnote{

In \namedref{Appendix}{sec:allbutone}, we show how the framework can be adapted to obtain an endemically secure $(n-1)$-out-of-$n$ OT.

}. Further, 
if the key agreement protocol is a one-round protocol, we obtain a one-round endemic OT. This implies that we get a one-round endemic OT from DDH, CDH and two round endemic OT from LWE, LPN, McEliece and Subset Sum. Note that \cite{TCC:GarIshSri18} have a one-round OT from LWE, DDH, QR in the CRS model.

In \sectionref{sec:otext}, we show that our construction is compatible with OT extension techniques. Concretely, we show that endemic OTs can be extended to a larger amount of endemic OTs using only one additional round. This allows us to obtain $\mathsf{poly}(\sec)$ OTs using only $O(\sec)$ public key operations in only two rounds. We revisit the OT extension protocol of Keller et al., Orr{\`u} et al. and Asharov et al. \cite{C:KelOrsSch15,RSA:OrrOrsSch17,JC:ALSZ17} under endemic security. It turns out that its uniform message security can be fully broken. We point out attacks and provide fixes such that classical, uniform and endemic security can be obtained. Finally, we observe that most OT extension protocols are implemented \cite{libOTe,KOS,EMP} using an ideal cipher in place of a random oracle. However, these implementations have no security proofs and we show that they too can be fully broken. We give new protocols and proofs in the ideal cipher model which allows a 10 times speed up on the ROM when implemented.  

In \sectionref{sec:impl}, we implement our construction based on the Diffie-Hellman key exchange and the Module LWE (\MLWE) based Kyber key encapsulation \cite{NISTPQC-R1:CRYSTALS-KYBER17}. We emphasize that it can also be instantiated with many of the other NIST post-quantum standardisation candidates and is to the best of our knowledge the first implementation of a quantum resistant OT.
